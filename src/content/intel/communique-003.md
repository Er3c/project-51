## The "Absurdity" Doctrine

The official response from the Kingdom of Denmark has been swift, sharp, and structurally defensive. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has categorized the Purchase Protocols as **"absurd,"** drawing a hard line in the Arctic snow.

> "Greenland is not for sale. Greenland is not Danish. Greenland belongs to Greenlanders. I strongly hope that this is not meant seriously." — *PM Mette Frederiksen*

### Nuuk's Stance: "We Are Not For Sale"

Local leadership in Nuuk echoed this sentiment, issuing a joint statement from all five political parties. The message is clear: **Self-determination is non-negotiable**.

*   **Identity**: "We do not want to be Americans, we do not want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders."
*   **Sovereignty**: The rejection is not just financial; it is existential. The 2009 Self-Government Act is cited as the legal shield against external acquisition.

### The NATO Paradox

This friction creates a unique geopolitical paradox. Denmark is a staunch NATO ally, yet the US Executive's aggressive real estate maneuvers threaten to destabilize the very alliance meant to secure the Arctic.
*   **The Risk**: Copenhagen warns that a forced US takeover could effectively end the NATO alliance structure in the North.
*   **The Reality**: While diplomats protest, strategic planners know that security dependencies often outweigh sovereignty rhetoric in the endgame.

### Committee Analysis

The "Project 51" algorithm interprets these rejections not as a final "No," but as the opening volley of a high-stakes negotiation. History shows that "absurd" ideas often become policy when the check is large enough or the security theat grows dark enough.

**Status**: *Diplomatic impasse observed. Economic pressure vectors continuing as planned.*
